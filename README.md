# Getting Started 
1. Install Python3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download pip (Google instructions per OS)
3. `python3 -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment. This is used to manage Python dependencies within just the context of your terminal instance. 
4. `source venv/bin/activate` to start your virtual environment 
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all project dependencies 
6. `FLASK_ENV=development flask run` to run the server in your terminal. The server will live update as you make code changes.

# Note on the Project Structure 
The project has been designed to follow the pattern of [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). Each layer has its dependencies injected in the `app.py` file to limit coupling between components.
